# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

### Overview
This project builds a logistic regression model to classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to leverage machine learning to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.

### Dataset
#### Source: UCI machine learning repositary.
It contains features extracted from tumor samples to classify them as benign (2) or malignant (4).

### Technologies used
•Python
•Jupyter Notebook
•Pandas
•Scikit-learn

### Project Workflow

#### Data Preprocessing:
• Load dataset
• Extract features (X) and target variable (y)

#### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
• Visualizing data distribution
• Identifying correlations

#### Splitting the Dataset:
• Training & Test sets

#### Train a logistic regression model:
• Logistic Regression implementation

#### Predictions
• Make predictions on test data

#### Comparing results
• using confusion matrix
• k-Fold cross validation

### Results
• Achieved high accuracy of 96% with logistic regression .
